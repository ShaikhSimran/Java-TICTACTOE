# Java-TICTACTOE
Developed an interactive console-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game project using Java programming language, showcasing proficiency in software development and object-oriented design principles. Conducted meticulous design and implementation, leveraging advanced algorithms and data structures to create a seamless gaming experience. 


Once the program is running, you will be prompted to input your moves. The input format is row number (1-3) followed by a space and then column number (1-3). For example, to place your mark in the top-left corner, you would input 1 1. Continue inputting your moves according to the prompts until the game ends.
